## Use of AI content generators

Current policy is to DECLINE any contributions which are believed to include or derive from AI generated content. This includes ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Llama and similar tools.

This policy does not apply to other uses of AI, such as researching APIs or algorithms, static analysis, or debugging, provided their output is not to be included in contributions.

Examples of tools impacted by this policy includes GitHub's CoPilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Code Llama, and code/content generation agents which are built on top of such tools.

This policy may evolve as AI tools mature and the legal situation is clarifed. In the meanwhile, requests for exceptions to this policy will be evaluated by me on a case by case basis.
